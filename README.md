# ***PYTHON KMEANS CLUSTERING: ANNALYSIS IRIS DATA***

## ***INTRODUCTION***

* The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.
* K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K.

## ***INSTALLATION***

* You can install this project in [ANNALYSIS IRIS DATA](https://github.com/ThadaPhan/Analysis_Iris-data-set_By_KMean-Cluster_With_Python.git)

## ***BUILD***

* First, make sure you was install pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib package.
* After that you can easy to run project. You have 2 file: *main.py* and *iris.csv*, you just copy it into Pycharm object (or any compiler program you using) and to run it.
